This project aims to detect spam messages in SMS using machine learning techniques. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms, the system identifies whether a given message is spam or not.

The dataset used in this project is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of SMS messages labeled as 'spam' or 'ham' (non-spam). The dataset has been preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
